The goal of this exercise is to make the thumb of the slider that you created in exercise 1 draggable.

Steps:
1. Modify MySliderView.
2. Detect touch events on the thumb.
3. Implement thumb drag.

Notes:
1. Thumb's motion must be restricted to a single dimension.
2. Within the motion dimension, thumb's range must be restricted to the underlying slider's track.
