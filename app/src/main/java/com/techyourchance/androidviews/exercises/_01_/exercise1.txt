The goal of this exercise is to draw the basic shape constituting a "slider" on the screen.

Steps:
1. Modify MySliderView
2. Draw a horizontal line
3. Draw a circular filled thumb in the center of the line (use Paint.Style.FILL)

Since the thumb will move left and right to the edges of the View in the future, leave margins equal to thumb's radius on either side of the line.
