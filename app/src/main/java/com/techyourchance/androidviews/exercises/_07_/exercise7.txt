The goal of this exercise is to implement coupons indicator panel.

Steps:
1. Modify CouponsView.
2. Account for the possibility that coupons info can be bound to the view before or after onSizeChanged() callback.
3. Calculate the size of a single "cell" where coupon's number will be shown using the total coupons count.
4. Draw the cells (first and last cells with rounded corners).
5. Calculate the maximum size of a text based on cell's size and the cell padding (assume at most double digit numbers).
6. Draw numeric labels inside the cells (centered both vertically and horizontally).
7. Use Paint.alpha property to make the "used" coupons' labels semi-transparent.
