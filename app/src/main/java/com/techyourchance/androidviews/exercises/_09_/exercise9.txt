The goal of this exercise is to implement a draggable crosshair element.

Steps:
1. Modify CrosshairView.
2. Implement the required UI without drag feature using matrix transformations.
3. Add drag feature (can copy-paste code from DragCircleView demo).
4. Implement support for config changes and process death.


Hint:
The "hairs" of the crosshair are straight radial lines. The "first hair" is drawn at a 45 degrees angle, and the angle between each adjacent pair of "hairs" is 90 degrees.
