The goal of this exercise is to add scale animation to the animated checkmark you created previously.

Steps:
1. Modify MyCheckmarkView
2. Add additional animation after the path animation finishes (use doOnEnd extension of ValueAnimator).
3. To animate scale factor, use ValueAnimator.ofFloat(1f, 1.2f, 1f).
4. To scale the contents of the View, use Canvas.scale(scaleX, scaleY, pivotX, pivotY) API before drawing.
