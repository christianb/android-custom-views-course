The goal of this exercise is to add value tracking to the slider that you created.

Steps:
1. Modify MySliderView.
2. Add a public property of type SliderChangeListener.
3. Compute the slider's value depending on thumb's position on the track (left: 0; right: 1.0).
4. Whenever the value changes, notify the attached SliderChangeListener.
5. Make sure that the current slider's value is a public property (or add a public getter method).
6. Add a text field to MySliderFragment and show the current slider's value in it.
