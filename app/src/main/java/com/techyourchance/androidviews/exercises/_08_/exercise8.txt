The goal of this exercise is to implement states progression indicator.

Steps:
1. Modify StatesProgressionView.
2. Draw bullets with states' names in correct positions using just active color.
3. Account for the current state and gray-out the inactive states.
4. Set dimensions of StatesProgressionView to wrap the shown states (with margins).

Hint:
Custom View's onMeasure() won't be called after invalidate(). To inform the system about changes of View's dimensions at runtime, call requestLayout().
