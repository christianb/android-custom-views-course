The goal of this exercise is to draw an animated checkmark on the screen.

Steps:
1. Modify MyCheckmarkView
2. Use View's width and height to calculate the maximum checkmark's size (assume 90 degrees angle and the long stroke being 2x the length of the short stroke) *
3. Calculate checkmark's vertices of interest (start, pivot, end)
4. Draw a static, non-animated checkmark on the screen using Path object
5. Draw an animated checkmark using the static Path as a reference for PathMeasure



Hints:
*
If we designate the length of the short stroke as a, then the length of the long stroke is 3a.
Since this checkmark is basically an inverted right (orthogonal) triangle, the following formulas apply:

width = sqrt(a^2 + (2a)^2)
height = a * 2a / sqrt(a^2 + (2a)^2) = 2a / sqrt(5)

You need to find maximum value for a, such that both width and height of the checkmark fit into View's bounds (you'll probably need a bit of padding too).
